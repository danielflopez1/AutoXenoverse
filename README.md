# AutoXenoverse2

I wanted to test pid windows fullscreen switch and inputs using CRDKeyboard. Therefore, I created a script that switches to the pid of Xenoverse 2 game and sends macros to win in the turn based minigame of Beerus and Vi with my current players.

## Prerequisite

* Xenoverse 2 game, 2 lvl 50 champions with added strength on the first turn.
* pywin32

# Warning
Use at your own risk of getting your account banned! I do not aprove of cheating, I wanted to test pid windows fullscreen switch and inputs using CRDKeyboard (note that clicks would have been easier).
