# AutoXenoverse2

The game required too much grinding for experience for the minigame. Therefore, I created a script that switches to the pid of Xenoverse game and sends macros to win in the turn based minigame of Beerus and Vi with my current players. It also loops so it can be left overnight while getting experience points. 

## Prerequisite

* Xenoverse 2 game, 2 lvl 50 champions with added strength on the first turn.
* pywin32

# Warning
Use at your own risk of getting your account banned! I do not aprove of cheating, I wanted to test pid windows fullscreen switch and inputs using CRDKeyboard (note that clicks would have been easier).
